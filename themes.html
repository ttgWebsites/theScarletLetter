					<li data-theme="b">Developing One's Identity</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Hester is forced by the community to brand all of her clothes with a scarlet colored letter A so that everyone in town will know she is an adulterer</li>
<li data-theme="c">She could have left the community and started a new life, casting away the letter and her bad image, yet she chooses to stay and establish her own new identity</li>
<li data-theme="d">She does not let the letter get to her, and seems to embrace it so as not to let society know she is ashamed of her past mistakes</li>
<li data-theme="c">Hester takes advantage of her situation to establish an identity for herself, and takes pride in who she is</li>
<li data-theme="d">On the other hand, Dimmesdale struggles with identity throughout, as he was also part of the sin leading to Hester's child</li>
<li data-theme="c">He is filled with anguish and remorse, as he can not be their for Hester, and she suffers the shame alone</li>
<li data-theme="d">Dimmesdale does not know how to shape his identity into something positive, and ultimately leads to his suffering and death</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Essence of Sin</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The citizens of Hester's town constantly debate who the "black man" is, as they believe the "black man" is the embodiment of the devil and sin</li>
					<li data-theme="c">As a very Christian society, many of the townspeople are often looking for the cause of sin and crime in the community by relating it to the devil's doing</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Many of the people see Chillingworth as the "black man" for his mysterious ways and the lock he seems to put over Dimmesdale as suggestion of his evilness</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The townspeople also look at Hester's child, Pearl, as the Devil's child, as not only was she born in sin, but she also is different than many other kids in the society, however that may be due to her lack of socialization and being considered an outcast</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Though many characters are searching for an unearthly explanation for sin, it is more so derived from the perversion of love</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Hester is very distant from her husband, and he takes advantage of her. When they are separated she seeks the affection of another man, even though it is a sin, due to the lack of affection she receives from her husband</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Chillingworth is very upset by Hester's infidelity, and views their relationship as more of a possessive one, rather than a mutual bond, therefore he spends his time trying to make Dimmesdale's life miserable for his role in bringing to life Pearl</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The nature of sin seems to derive through one's personal relationships rather than an underlying evil</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The results of sin, and our nature as humans to sin</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Sin is a very important part of the Christian religion, and plays an important role in the novel</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the bible the earliest tales of sin come from the story of Adam & Eve. Adam & Eve eat a forbidden fruit that gives them knowledge, but in doing so they break God's one rule and forever banned from the Garden of Eden, and are forever after sinful by nature</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The initial sin of Hester and Dimmesdale is similar in that it results in their expulsions from society</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Hester is an outcast and must show that everyday, while Dimmesdale must hide his sign and is an outcast towards his daughter and lover</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They are also both burdened with the knowledge of what it is to be human after their sin, much like Adam & Eve</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The two must deal with the consequences of their actions and strive to make the best of the situation they have landed themselves in</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Hester does seem to do this as she embraces her sin, yet Dimmesdale as a religious figure has trouble doing so and ultimately suffers</li>
