					<li data-theme="b">Explain the significance of the scarlet letter and its ability to alter Hester's identity.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Hester is assigned the scarlet letter she is forced to wear it as a symbol of her adultery.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However she choses to decorate it initially as a way to stand up to those who force the letter upon her.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Through the decoration she shows that the letter will not define her.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Eventually after she is allowed to remove the letter she decides against it as removing it would show that wearing it had an effect.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">She also refuses to allow the meaning to shift, as some in the community come to see it as "Able" instead of adulterer, however Hester prefers to keep the original meaning as it represents her past deed, which she does not regret.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">In the end Hester returns to Europe and becomes a symbol of female repression, she uses the experience and the letter to stand up not only for herself but for women in general.</li>

					<li data-theme="b">The novel uses various symbols throughout; however the Puritans and the narrator seem to have a different view of symbols, explain.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In the novel the Puritans are constantly seeking natural symbols in belief that they are messages from God.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They however do not often take the symbols at face value; instead interpreting them in any way they seem conforms to their beliefs.
					<li data-theme="d">The greatest example of this is the letter A traced in the sky by a meteor.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">To Dimmesdale and the townspeople nearby it represents the matter at hand, the adultery, meanwhile to the minister, it represents his sin, and to even more people it represents the governor who just died passing into heaven as an angel.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">This wide array of ideas as to what the letter in the sky refers to goes to show that the Puritan community can take any symbol and turn it into something meaningful that aligns with their beliefs.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The narrator on the other hand uses symbols in a different way, rather to complicate reality than to confirm what one believes.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The best example of this is the description of the Governor's garden.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Though the Governor's mansion is kept neat and is an elegant home, his garden is very unkempt and filled with weeds.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The narrator uses this to represent that despite the Governor's appearance of order and control, he is not a great caretaker, both of his garden, and of the people in his community.</li>
